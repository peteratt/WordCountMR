
"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day

which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning

miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,

'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.

trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would

taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said

winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.

lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,

and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost

would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.

and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.

slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.

But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.

parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen

now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel

because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.

He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.

giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.

children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could

first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,

But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since

because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,

Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the

of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently

shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went straight
forward to recovery. Soon he was pottering about downstairs.
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little. Now he wanted
her to continue. He often put his band to his head, pulled down
the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not feel.
But there was no deceiving her. At first she merely smiled to herself.
Then she scolded him sharply.

"Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."

That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign sickness.

"I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.

Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.

Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some time.
Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending on her almost
like a child, was rather happy. Neither knew that she was more tolerant
because she loved him less. Up till this time, in spite of all,
he had been her husband and her man. She had felt that, more or less,
what he did to himself he did to her. Her living depended on him.
There were many, many stages in the ebbing of her love for him,
but it was always ebbing.

Now, with the birth of this third baby, her self no longer set
towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide that scarcely rose,
standing off from him. After this she scarcely desired him.
And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so much part
of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did not mind
so much what he did, could leave him alone.

There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,
which is like autumn in a man's life. His wife was casting him off,
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning
now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more
or less a husk. And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,
yielding their place to their children.

During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship
of the first months of their marriage. He sat at home and,
when the children were in bed, and she was sewing--she did all her
sewing by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing--he would
read to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering
the words like a man pitching quoits. Often she hurried him on,
giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly.

The silences between them were peculiar. There would be
the swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his
lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars
as he spat in the fire. Then her thoughts turned to William.
Already he was getting a big boy. Already he was top of the class,
and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school.
She saw him a man, young, full of vigour, making the world glow
again for her.

And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing
to think about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable. His soul
would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.
He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.
He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in
that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression
on their breathing when they were left together for some time.
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone,
working, thinking, living.

Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace
and tenderness between the separating parents. Paul was seventeen
months old when the new baby was born. He was then a plump,
pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar
slight knitting of the brows. The last child was also a boy,
fair and bonny. Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;
but not for the sake of the infant.

They called the baby Arthur. He was very pretty, with a
mop of gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.
Mrs. Morel was glad this child loved the father. Hearing the
miner's footsteps, the baby would put up his arms and crow.
And if Morel were in a good temper, he called back immediately,
in his hearty, mellow voice:

"What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."

And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.

"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father's
kisses and play. Then Morel laughed joyfully.

"He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.

And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the
children included the father in her heart.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer,
and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on
the sofa.

"What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.

"What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.

"I don't know," sobbed the child.

So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him,
but without effect. It made her feel beside herself. Then the father,
always impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:

"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."

"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.
And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his
little chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"

And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his eye,
or at last he cried himself to sleep. These fits were not often,
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment
of Paul was different from that of the other children.

Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley
of the Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.
It was the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.

"Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."

"Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel. "Why, what's the matter?"

"A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n
'is back," Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."

"Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs. Morel.

"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a right to get hold
of the boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children,
and even if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."

"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"
retorted Mrs. Anthony. "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose---"

"I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.

"Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.

Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate. Her hand trembled
as she held her mug of barm.

"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.

At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted
to be off again--he was then eleven years old--his mother said to him:

"What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"

"When did I tear his collar?"

"I don't know when, but his mother says you did."

"Why--it was yesterday--an' it was torn a'ready."

"But you tore it more."

"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen--an'
Alfy Ant'ny 'e says:

'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,
Went down to a river to bade.

"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."

"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched
out of the house with his bundle. She sat trembling slightly,
but her heart brimming with contempt. What would she do if he went
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?
But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him.
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.

"Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.

"He says he's run away," replied the mother.

"Where to?"

"Eh, I don't know. He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,
and says he's not coming back."

"What shall we do?" cried the boy.

"Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."

"But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.

And she and William retired to the sofa and wept. Mrs. Morel
sat and laughed.

"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed. "You'll see him before
the night's out."

But the children were not to be consoled. Twilight came on.
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness. One part of her said
it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could
not quite let him go. At the bottom, she knew very well he could
NOT go.

When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,
however, she felt something behind the door. So she looked.
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle. She sat on a piece
of coal and laughed. Every time she saw it, so fat and yet
so ignominious, slunk into its corner in the dark, with its ends
flopping like dejected ears from the knots, she laughed again.
She was relieved.

Mrs. Morel sat waiting. He had not any money, she knew,
so if he stopped he was running up a bill. She was very tired of him--
tired to death. He had not even the courage to carry his bundle
beyond the yard-end.

As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky. She said not a word.
He took off his coat, and slunk to his armchair, where he began
to take off his boots.

"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"
she said quietly.

"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," he said,
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be impressive.

"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your
parcel through the yard-end," she said.

He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.

"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.
"But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning."

Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning presently
and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway,
holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart was bitter,
because she had loved him. 

DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which,
strangely enough, he would often pay for himself.

"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said. "It's a
winder as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."

So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite
first medicine. And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea. He had
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs:
wormwood, rue, horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt,
marshmallow, hyssop, dandelion, and centaury. Usually there was a jug of
one or other decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.

"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood. "Grand!"
And he exhorted the children to try.

"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.
But they were not to be tempted.

This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs
would shift the "nasty peens in his head". He was sickening for an
attack of an inflammation of the brain. He had never been well since
his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham.
Since then he had drunk and stormed. Now he fell seriously ill,
and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse. He was one of the worst
patients imaginable. But, in spite of all, and putting aside the
fact that he was breadwinner, she never quite wanted him to die.
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.

The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some
had the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the
downstairs work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.
But it was a great drag, nevertheless. It was not every day
the neighbours helped. Then she had nursing of baby and husband,
cleaning and cooking, everything to do. She was quite worn out,
but she did what was wanted of her.

And the money was just sufficient. She had seventeen
shillings a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other
butty put by a portion of the stall's profits for Morel's wife.
And the neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids'
trifles. If they had not helped her so generously in those times,
Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring
debts that would have dragged her down.

The weeks passed. Morel, almost against hope, grew better.
