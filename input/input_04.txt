Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang

The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning

was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,

of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.

his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,

rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.

who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,

in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.

She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops

with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman

had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched

Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.

back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts

He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends

to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's

their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather

and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain
to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.

But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for
some minutes. Then:

"Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.

"What do you want HIM for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had guessed.

"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his
pit-bottle on to the dresser.

"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning
to you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.

"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel. "When I get
hold of 'IM I'll make his bones rattle."

"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready
to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales
against your own children."

"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel. "It none matters to me whose
lad 'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's
a mind."

"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.
"He was running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he
accidentally got hold of his collar, because the other dodged--as
an Anthony would."

"I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.

"You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.

"Niver you mind," stormed Morel. "I know my business."

"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children."

"I know," repeated Morel.

And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.
Suddenly William ran in, saying:

"Can I have my tea, mother?"

"Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.

"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look
so ridiculous."

"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,
rising from his chair and glaring at his son.

William, who was a tall lad for his years, but very sensitive,
had gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.

"Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.

William had not the wit to move. Suddenly Morel clenched
his fist, and crouched.

"I'll GI'E him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.

"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage. "You shall
not touch him for HER telling, you shall not!"

"Shonna I?" shouted Morel. "Shonna I?"

And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward. Mrs. Morel sprang
in between them, with her fist lifted.

"Don't you DARE!" she cried.

"What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment. "What!"

She spun round to her son.

"GO out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.

The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late. He returned, pale under
his pit-dirt with fury. But now his wife was fully roused.

"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice. "Only dare,
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."

He was afraid of her. In a towering rage, he sat down.

When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel
joined the Women's Guild. It was a little club of women attached
to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
Adam an' Eve got drownded,
Who do yer think got saved?'

An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-YOU,' an' so I pinched 'im, an'
'e was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.
An' so I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im,
'e dodged, an' it ripped 'is collar. But I got my cobbler---"

He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging on
a string. This old cobbler had "cobbled"--hit and smashed--seventeen
other cobblers on similar strings. So the boy was proud of his veteran.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip
his collar."

"Well, our mother!" he answered. "I never meant tr'a done it--an'
it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."

"Next time," said his mother, "YOU be more careful.
I shouldn't like it if you came home with your collar torn off."

"I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."

The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.

"No--well, you be more careful."

William fled away, glad to be exonerated. And Mrs. Morel,
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would explain

to the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night
in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op". The
women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from
co-operation, and other social questions. Sometimes Mrs. Morel
read a paper. It seemed queer to the children to see their mother,
who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in her
rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.

But they loved the Guild. It was the only thing to which they
did not grudge their mother--and that partly because she enjoyed it,
partly because of the treats they derived from it. The Guild
was called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop--that is, the gossip-shop. It
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own,
rather disconcerting. And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot of news
on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to be in when
their mother came home, because she told him things.

Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in
the "Co-op." office. He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather
rough features and real viking blue eyes.

"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?"
said Morel. "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an'
earn nowt. What's 'e startin' wi'?"

"It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.

"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy
ten shillin' a wik from th' start. But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."

"He is NOT going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's
an end of it."

"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."

"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason
why I should do the same with my lad."

"Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"

"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.

She was very proud of her son. He went to the night school,
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except one.
Then he taught in the night schools. But he was so fiery that only
his good-nature and his size protected him.

All the things that men do--the decent things--William did.
He could run like the wind. When he was twelve he won a first
prize in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.
It stood proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.
The boy only ran for her. He flew home with his anvil, breathless,
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.
She took it like a queen.

"How pretty!" she exclaimed.

Then he began to get ambitious. He gave all his money to
his mother. When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood. The townlet contained
nothing higher than the clergyman. Then came the bank manager,
then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that the hosts
of colliers. Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist,
the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen. He played billiards in
the Mechanics' Hall. Also he danced--this in spite of his mother.
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the sixpenny-hops
down Church Street, to sports and billiards.

Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of
flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's
heart for a brief fortnight.

Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant
swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door,
and immediately she sniffed the air.

"Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.

"My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.

"I--I mean YOUNG Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.

"Which one? There are several."

Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.

"I--I met Mr. Morel--at Ripley," she explained.

"Oh--at a dance!"

"Yes."

"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.
And he is NOT at home."

Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the
girl away so rudely. He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often with his cap
pushed jollily to the back of his head. Now he came in frowning.
He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw in his hand,
and glared down at his mother. She was small, with her hair
taken straight back from her forehead. She had a quiet air
of authority, and yet of rare warmth. Knowing her son was angry,
she trembled inwardly.

"Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.

"I don't know about a lady. There was a girl came."

"And why didn't you tell me?"

"Because I forgot, simply."

He fumed a little.

"A good-looking girl--seemed a lady?"

"I didn't look at her."

"Big brown eyes?"

"I did NOT look. And tell your girls, my son, that when they're
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for you.
Tell them that--brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."

"I'm sure she was a nice girl."

"And I'm sure she wasn't."

There ended the altercation. Over the dancing there was a great
strife between the mother and the son. The grievance reached its
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard--considered
a low town--to a fancy-dress ball. He was to be a Highlander.
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends
had had, and which fitted him perfectly. The Highland suit came home.
Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.

"My suit come?" cried William.

"There's a parcel in the front room."

He rushed in and cut the string.

"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,
showing her the suit.

"You know I don't want to fancy you in it."

On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.

"Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.

"No; I don't want to see you," she replied.

She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.
She was afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.
He hesitated a moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.
He picked it up gleefully, forgetting her. She went out.

When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and got
a situation in Nottingham. In his new place he had thirty shillings
a week instead of eighteen. This was indeed a rise. His mother and
his father were brimmed up with pride. Everybody praised William.
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly. Mrs. Morel hoped,
with his aid, to help her younger sons. Annie was now studying
to be a teacher. Paul, also very clever, was getting on well,
having lessons in French and German from his godfather, the clergyman
who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel. Arthur, a spoilt and very
good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but there was talk
