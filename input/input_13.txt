
"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle

preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;

got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share

When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick

derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,

But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:

where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she

an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped

to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting

The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,

the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,

ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,

with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,

in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.

as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share

he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,

ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,

with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,

in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.

as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share

he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

A frown went over his face, but he said nothing. She glanced
round the kitchen. It was small and curious to her, with its
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures,
its wooden chairs and little deal table. At that moment Morel
came in.

"Hello, dad!"

"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"

The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth.

"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"

Morel bowed obsequiously.

"I'm very well, and I hope so are you. You must make yourself
very welcome."

"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.

"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.

"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."

"It is no trouble. Annie will take you. Walter, carry up
this box."

"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William
to his betrothed.

Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and Mrs. Morel
had vacated for her. It, too, was small and cold by candlelight.
The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness.

"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.

"Oh, thank you very much!"

Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot water.

"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.
"It's a beastly journey, and we had such a rush."

"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, she'll be all right."

But there was a chill in the atmosphere. After half an hour
Miss Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,
very fine for the collier's kitchen.

"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.

"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile
to Mrs. Morel. "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"

"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel. "That's not very nice of him."

"It isn't, really!"

"You are cold," said the mother. "Won't you come near the fire?"

Morel jumped out of his armchair.

"Come and sit you here!" he cried. "Come and sit you here!"

"No, dad, keep your own chair. Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.

"No, no!" cried Morel. "This cheer's warmest. Come and sit here,
Miss Wesson."

"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself
in the collier's armchair, the place of honour. She shivered,
feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.

"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her mouth
to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone;
which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to
be present. The young lady evidently did not realise them as people:
they were creatures to her for the present. William winced.

In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have been
a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her,
certainly clownish--in short, the working classes. How was she
to adjust herself?

"I'll go," said Annie.

Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief,
she said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.

She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had been
so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous,
and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat
round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess.
Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups,
the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The
children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange,
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.

At about ten o'clock he said to her:

"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"

"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones
and putting her head slightly on one side.

"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.

"Very well," replied the mother.

Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.

"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.

Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap
into a stone beer-bottle. Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night. She was to share
the room with the lady, because the house was full.

"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie. And Annie sat
nursing the hot-water bottle. Miss Western shook hands all round,
to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded by William.
In five minutes he was downstairs again. His heart was rather sore;
he did not know why. He talked very little till everybody had gone
to bed, but himself and his mother. Then he stood with his legs apart,
in his old attitude on the hearthrug, and said hesitatingly:

"Well, mother?"

"Well, my son?"

She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and humiliated,
for his sake.

"Do you like her?"

"Yes," came the slow answer.

"She's shy yet, mother. She's not used to it. It's different

"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically. "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."

"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul. "I think the first
one with bare shoulders is lovely."

"Do you?" answered his mother. "Well, I don't."

On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.
He had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his
waistcoat pocket. He loved it with its bars of yellow across.
His mother packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set
off at a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train. Mrs. Morel came
to the entry-end to see him off.

It was a perfect morning. From the ash tree the slender
green fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily
down on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe
corn shimmered, and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.
Puffs of wind came. Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him
so powerfully.

"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very unhappy.

"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.

She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him
as he crossed the field. He had a small, compact body that looked
full of life. She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field,
that where he determined to go he would get. She thought of William.
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.
He was away in London, doing well. Paul would be working in Nottingham.
Now she had two sons in the world. She could think of two places,
great centres of industry, and feel that she had put a man into each
of them, that these men would work out what SHE wanted; they were
derived from her, they were of her, and their works also would be hers.
ARTHUR MOREL was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy,
a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he
had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.

In appearance he remained the flower of the family,
being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair
and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with
long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper,
made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.

His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.
He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.

"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who,
he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you
can't alter it, put up with it."

And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him,
he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin.
His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being,
shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean
and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness
and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or
ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners
got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the
children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence,
the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners
in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.

"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it.
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them,
and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive
at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing
up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst
of all.

Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous
hatred of his children.

"There's not a man tries harder for his family!" he would shout.
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.
But I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"

But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard
as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle
now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting
in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.
They loathed him.

Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he
won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only
come home at week-ends.

Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning
about four shillings a week. But soon she would have fifteen shillings,
since she had passed her examination, and there would be financial
peace in the house.

Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul. He was quiet and not brilliant.
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.
Everything he did was for her. She waited for his coming home
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she
had pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.
He sat and listened with his earnestness. The two shared lives.

William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas. The children gasped
at such a fabulous price.

"Eight guineas!" said Morel. "More fool him! If he'd gen me
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."

"Given YOU some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel. "Why give YOU
some of it!"

She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all,
and she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like
great swells.

He wanted to bring the girl home. Mrs. Morel said she
should come at the Christmas. This time William arrived with
a lady, but with no presents. Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.
Hearing footsteps, she rose and went to the door. William entered.

"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside
to present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine
black-and-white check, and furs.

"Here's Gyp!"

Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile.

"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.

"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.

"Oh no, we had dinner in the train. Have you got my gloves, Chubby?"

William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.

"How should I?" he said.

"Then I've lost them. Don't be cross with me."

and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick
twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech,
as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse,
