from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the

like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow

and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her

wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her

wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,

their greenness.

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,

At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,

in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller

waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William

DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young

wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

rather strangely.

with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young

I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white

everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep

"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending

rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected

shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight

in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected

And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally

But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs

this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went

rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went

rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

and mighty, "do you like it?"

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went

rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.

a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's

fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was

"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,

when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel,
"if she holds you no more than that!"

"It IS funny!" he exclaimed. It worried and perplexed him.
"But yet--there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."

"You know best," said Mrs. Morel. "But if it is as you say, I
wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings,
to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
suffered from the long hours and the confinement. His mother,
to whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.

His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon. On a Monday
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:

"I think it will be a fine day."

He looked up in surprise. This meant something.

"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.
Well, he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers,
and I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine. Shall we go?"

"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried. "And we'll go
this afternoon?"

Paul hurried off to the station jubilant. Down Derby Road
was a cherry-tree that glistened. The old brick wall by the
Statutes ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.
And the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust,
splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside
the warehouse all the morning, the boy had
a vision of spring outside.

When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.

"Are we going?" he asked.

"When I'm ready," she replied.

Presently he got up.

"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.

She did so. He washed the pots, straightened, and then took
her boots. They were quite clean. Mrs. Morel was one of those naturally
exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes.
But Paul had to clean them for her. They were kid boots at eight
shillings a pair. He, however, thought them the most dainty boots
in the world, and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they
had been flowers.

Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.
She had got a new cotton blouse on. Paul jumped up and went forward.

"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed. "What a bobby-dazzler!"

She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.

"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied. "It's very quiet."

She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.

"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high
and mighty, "do you like it?"

"Awfully! You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"

He went and surveyed her from the back.

"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,
I should say: 'Doesn't THAT little person fancy herself!"'

"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel. "She's not sure it
suits her."

"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was
wrapped in burnt paper. It DOES suit you, and I say you look nice."

She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending
to know better.

"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.
You couldn't have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"

"I should think you couldn't," he replied.

"And, you know, it's good stuff."

"Awfully pretty," he said.

The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and black.

"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.

"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust. "Why don't you
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."

"I s'll soon have no need," she replied. "I'm going white
fast enough."

"Well, you've no business to," he said. "What do I want
with a white-haired mother?"

"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she said
rather strangely.

They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William
had given her, because of the sun. Paul was considerably taller
than she, though he was not big. He fancied himself.

On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily. Minton pit
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.

"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel. Mother and son stood on
the road to watch. Along the ridge of the great pit-hill crawled
a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small truck,
and a man. They climbed the incline against the heavens.
At the end the man tipped the wagon. There was an undue rattle
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.

"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on
a bank, whilst he sketched rapidly. She was silent whilst he worked,
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among
their greenness.

"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully
beautiful."

"And so's the pit," he said. "Look how it heaps together,
like something alive almost--a big creature that you don't know."

"Yes," she said. "Perhaps!"

"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts
from her aunt's house, you know."

"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."

"She does." Then he frowned swiftly. "If only she wouldn't
put on her BLESSED airs!"

"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy. She'll be all right."

"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully. But his brow
was gloomy. "You know, she's not like you, mother. She's not serious,
and she can't think."

"She's young, my boy."

"Yes; and she's had no sort of show. Her mother died when she was
a child. Since then she's lived with her aunt, whom she can't bear.
And her father was a rake. She's had no love."

"No! Well, you must make up to her."

"And so--you have to forgive her a lot of things."

"WHAT do you have to forgive her, my boy?"

"I dunno. When she seems shallow, you have to remember she's
never had anybody to bring her deeper side out. And she's FEARFULLY
fond of me."

"Anybody can see that."

"But you know, mother--she's--she's different from us.
Those sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem
to have the same principles."

"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.

But he seemed uneasy within himself.

In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round
the house.

"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs. "Are you getting up?"

"Yes," her voice called faintly.

"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.

Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.
She did not come down in half an hour.

"Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was?" he asked
of Annie.

"Yes, she was," replied Annie.

He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.

"Happy New Year," he called.

"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.

"Buck up!" he implored.

It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.
Morel, who always rose before six, looked at the clock.

"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.

The family had breakfasted, all but William. He went
to the foot of the stairs.

"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,
rather crossly. She only laughed. The family expected, after that
time of preparation, something like magic. At last she came,
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.

"Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready?" he asked.

"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it,
Mrs. Morel?"

She played the grand lady at first. When she went with William
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs
and London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.
And Morel, standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road,
watching the gallant pair go, felt he was the father of princes
and princesses.

And yet she was not so grand. For a year now she had been
a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office. But while she
was with the Morels she queened it. She sat and let Annie or Paul
wait on her as if they were her servants. She treated Mrs. Morel
with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage. But after a day
or so she began to change her tune.

William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them
on their walks. It was so much more interesting. And Paul really
DID admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.

On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know
where I left my muff?" William replied:

"You know it is in your bedroom. Why do you ask Annie?"

And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth. But it
angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister.

On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together
in the parlour by the fire in the dark. At a quarter to eleven
Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came out to the kitchen,
followed by his beloved.

"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said. She had been
sitting alone.

"It is not LATE, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."

"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.

"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."

"Can't you trust us, mother?"

"Whether I can or not, I won't do it. You can stay till eleven
if you like, and I can read."

"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl. "We won't keep
mater waiting."

"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;
"I think you will see."

"Yes, thank you. Good-night, Mrs. Morel."

William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs,
and she went. He returned to the kitchen.

"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.

"My boy, I tell you I don't BELIEVE in leaving two young
things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."

And he was forced to take this answer. He kissed his mother
good-night.

At Easter he came over alone. And then he discussed his
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.

"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for her
a bit. I shouldn't care if I never saw her again. But, then,
when I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."

wouldn't call it LOVE--at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."

"Oh, I don't know, mother. She's an orphan, and---"

They never came to any sort of conclusion. He seemed puzzled
and rather fretted. She was rather reserved. All his strength
and money went in keeping this girl. He could scarcely afford
to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over.

to his great joy. He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health
