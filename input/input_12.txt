at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,

word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her

won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's

been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood

"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,

word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her

won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's

been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood

"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,

word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her

won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's

been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood

"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,

word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her

won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's

been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood

"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,

word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her

won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's

been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood

"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,

word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her

won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's

been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood

"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,

word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her

won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's

been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood

"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.

In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket
and took it to the station. When he got back, his mother was just
beginning to wash the floor. He sat crouched up on the sofa.

"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.

"And how much will it be?"

"About one pound eleven," he said.

She went on washing her floor in silence.

"Is it a lot?" he asked.

"It's no more than I thought," she answered.

"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.

She did not answer, but went on with her work. At last she said:

"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd give
me a pound a month. He has given me ten shillings--twice; and now I
know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him. Not that I want it.
Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this ticket,
which I'd never expected."

"He earns a lot," said Paul.

"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds. But they're all alike.
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment
you get."

"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.

"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied;
"and am supposed to find money for extras. But they don't care
about helping you, once they've gone. He'd rather spend it on
that dressed-up creature."

"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.

"She should, but she hasn't. I asked him. And I know he
doesn't buy her a gold bangle for nothing. I wonder whoever bought
ME a gold bangle."

William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.
He asked the girl--her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western--for a
photograph to send to his mother. The photo came--a handsome brunette,
taken in profile, smirking slightly--and, it might be, quite naked,
for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen,
only a naked bust.

"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of
Louie is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.
But do you think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to
give her young man that photo to send to his mother--the first?
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful, as you say. But I hardly
expected to see so much of them at the first view."

Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in
the parlour. He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.

"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.

"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.

"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an'
one as wunna do him owermuch good neither. Who is she?"

"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."

"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner. "An' is 'er
an actress?"

"She is not. She's supposed to be a lady."

"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo. "A lady,
is she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o'
game on?"

"On nothing. She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates,
and takes what bit of money's given her."

"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph. "Then he's
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."

"Dear Mater," William replied. "I'm sorry you didn't like
the photograph. It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you
mightn't think it decent. However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you another,
that I hope will please you better. She's always being photographed;
in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing."

Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note
from the girl. This time the young lady was seen in a black satin
evening bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black
lace hanging down her beautiful arms.
at Mr. Jordan. "It's the--it's the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer work
even sufficiently to supply him with the word. Feeling an utter fool,
and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the paper again.

"'Sir,--Please send me'--er--er--I can't tell the--er--'two
pairs--gris fil bas--grey thread stockings'--er--er--'sans--without'--
er--I can't tell the words--er--'doigts--fingers'--er--I can't tell the---"

He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused
to come. Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.

"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings
without TOES.'"

"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers'--as well--as
a rule---"

The little man looked at him. He did not know whether "doigts"
meant "fingers"; he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant "toes".

"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.

"Well, it DOES mean fingers," the boy persisted.

He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.
Mr. Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother,
who sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor
who have to depend on the favour of others.

"And when could he come?" he asked.

"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish. He has finished
school now."

"He would live in Bestwood?"

"Yes; but he could be in--at the station--at quarter to eight."

"H'm!"

It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight
shillings a week. The boy did not open his mouth to say another
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers". He
followed his mother down the stairs. She looked at him with her
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.

"I think you'll like it," she said.

"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.
I couldn't read the writing."

"Never mind, my boy. I'm sure he'll be all right, and you
won't see much of him. Wasn't that first young fellow nice?
I'm sure you'll like them."

"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it all?"

"I suppose he was a workman who has got on," she said.
"You mustn't mind people so much. They're not being disagreeable
to YOU--it's their way. You always think people are meaning things
for you. But they don't."

It was very sunny. Over the big desolate space of the market-place
the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened.
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity, and the shadow was full
of colour. Just where the horse trams trundled across the market
was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit blazing in the sun--apples
and piles of reddish oranges, small green-gage plums and bananas.
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed.
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank.

"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.

It was felt to be a reckless extravagance. Paul had only
been in an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only
to have a cup of tea and a bun. Most of the people of Bestwood
considered that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef,
was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham. Real cooked dinner
was considered great extravagance. Paul felt rather guilty.

They found a place that looked quite cheap. But when Mrs. Morel
scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so dear.
So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish.

"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.

"Never mind," she said. "We won't come again."

She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he
liked sweets.

"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.

"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."

And she looked round for the waitress. But the waitress
was busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.
So the mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she
flirted among the men.

"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul. "Look now,
she's taking that man HIS pudding, and he came long after us."

"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.

Mrs. Morel was angry. But she was too poor, and her orders
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her
rights just then. They waited and waited.

"Should we go, mother?" he said.

Then Mrs. Morel stood up. The girl was passing near.

"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs. Morel clearly.

The girl looked round insolently.

"Directly," she said.

"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.

In a moment the girl came back with the tart. Mrs. Morel
asked coldly for the bill. Paul wanted to sink through the floor.
He marvelled at his mother's hardness. He knew that only years
of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.
She shrank as much as he.

"It's the last time I go THERE for anything!" she declared,
when they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.

"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one
or two places, shall we?"

They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel
wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.
But this indulgence he refused. He stood in front of milliners'
shops and drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to
be interested. They wandered on.

"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said. "They make
your mouth water. I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll
have to wait a bit before I get them."

Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway sniffing.

"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"

Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady
in black peering over the counter curiously.

"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother away.

"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.

"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily. "Look, there's
a tubful."

"So there is--red and white. But really, I never knew
stocks to smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved
out of the doorway, but only to stand in front of the window.

"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of
sight of the elegant young lady in black--the shop-girl. "Paul!
Just look here!"

He came reluctantly back.

"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.

"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound. "You'd think
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang
so big an' heavy."

"And such an abundance!" she cried.

"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"

"Yes!" she exclaimed. "Lovely!"

"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.

"I wonder!" she answered. "Not us."

"It would die in our parlour."

"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant
you put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."

They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings,
they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock,
in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine.

"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said Paul.
"I can go all round here and see everything. I s'll love it."

"You will," assented his mother.

He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother. They arrived
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.
