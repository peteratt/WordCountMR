
"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery.

to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,

could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,

One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense

simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could

swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been

blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in

mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,

back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water

I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly

he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.

very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.

who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.

in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.

Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.

oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery.

thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden

coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother

flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,

would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present

with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;

and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't

bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided

She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

Her beauty--that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive
thing--seemed nothing to her. Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,
was not enough. She must have something to reinforce her pride,
because she felt different from other people. Paul she eyed
rather wistfully. On the whole, she scorned the male sex.
But here was a new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could
be gentle and who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew
a lot, and who had a death in the family. The boy's poor
morsel of learning exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.
Yet she tried hard to scorn him, because he would not see in her
the princess but only the swine-girl. And he scarcely observed her.

Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak. Then she
would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms,
how she would love him!

As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness
of the morning. White clouds went on their way, crowding to the
back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime. The water
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows and
the thorn-trees.

It was four and a half miles' drive. Tiny buds on the hedges,
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes called,
and blackbirds shrieked and scolded. It was a new, glamorous world.

Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse walk
through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the
oak-wood, still bare. Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down.
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the good-looking,
ruddy farmer handed down to him.

Miriam appeared in the doorway. She was nearly sixteen,
very beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes
dilating suddenly like an ecstasy.

"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils
are nearly out. Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"

"Cold!" said Miriam, in her musical, caressing voice.

"The green on their buds---" and he faltered into silence timidly.

"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.

"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured. But he yielded
it to her.

Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.

"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said. "Let me take
your coat. It IS heavy. You mustn't walk far in it."

She helped him off with his coat. He was quite unused
to such attention. She was almost smothered under its weight.

"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen,
swinging the great milk-churns, "you've got almost more than you
can manage there."

She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.

The kitchen was very small and irregular. The farm had been
originally a labourer's cottage. And the furniture was old and battered.
But Paul loved it--loved the sack-bag that formed the hearthrug,
and the funny little corner under the stairs, and the small window
deep in the corner, through which, bending a little, be could see
the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond.

"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.

"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said. "Isn't it lovely coming out,
don't you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.
I'm glad it's sunny."

"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"

"No, thank you."

"How's your mother?"

"I think she's tired now. I think she's had too much to do.
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me. Then she'll
be able to rest. I s'll be glad if she can."

"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers. "It's a wonder she isn't
ill herself."

Miriam was moving about preparing dinner. Paul watched
everything that happened. His face was pale and thin, but his eyes
were quick and bright with life as ever. He watched the strange,
almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan. The atmosphere
was different from that of his own home, where everything seemed
so ordinary. When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had
come breaking in on her world. There was a sense of silence inside
the house and out. Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a maiden
in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical.
And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots seemed
only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.

She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her,
taking her all in. Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old
frock hurt her. She resented his seeing everything. Even he knew
that her stocking was not pulled up. She went into the scullery,
blushing deeply. And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at
her work. She nearly dropped all she handled. When her inside
dream was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation. She resented
that he saw so much.

Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she
was needed at her work. She was too polite to leave him.
Presently she excused herself and rose. After a while she looked
into the tin saucepan.

"Oh DEAR, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"

Miriam started as if she had been stung.

"HAVE they, mother?" she cried.

"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't
trusted them to you." She peered into the pan.

The girl stiffened as if from a blow. Her dark eyes dilated;
she remained standing in the same spot.


"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners sighed,
bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the steps again,
closing the door behind them.

The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box.
William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long. Like a monument
lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin. Paul thought it would never
be got out of the room again. His mother was stroking the polished wood.

They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves
in the warmth.

Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and
take her old bright interest in life. She remained shut off.
All the way home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it
could have been me! "

When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her
coarse apron. She always used to have changed her dress and put
on a black apron, before. Now Annie set his supper, and his mother
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her.

"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch
of a colliery at work was beautiful."

But Mrs. Morel took no notice. Night after night he forced
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen. It drove
him almost insane to have her thus. At last:

"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.

She did not hear.

"What's a-matter?" he persisted. "Mother, what's a-matter?"

"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.

The lad--he was sixteen years old--went to bed drearily.
He was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself. She could only
brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.

At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home. His mother looked at him,
and her heart stood still.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"I'm badly, mother!" he replied. "Mr. Jordan gave me five
shillings for a Christmas-box!"

He handed it to her with trembling hands. She put it on the table.

"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.

"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.

It was the old question.

"I feel badly, mother."

She undressed him and put him to bed. He had pneumonia dangerously,
the doctor said.

"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.

"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.

Mrs. Morel stood condemned on her own ground.

"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.

Paul was very ill. His mother lay in bed at nights with him;
they could not afford a nurse. He grew worse, and the crisis approached.
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last
flare of struggle, like madness.

"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.

She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:

"Oh, my son--my son!"

That brought him to. He realised her. His whole will rose
up and arrested him. He put his head on her breast, and took ease
of her for love.

"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul
was ill that Christmas. I believe it saved his mother."

Paul was in bed for seven weeks. He got up white and fragile.
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat
on the sofa chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in
perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.

William had been a prophet. Mrs. Morel had a little present
and a letter from Lily at Christmas. Mrs. Morel's sister had
a letter at the New Year.

"I was at a ball last night. Some delightful people were there,
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter. "I had every
dance--did not sit out one."

Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.

Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time
after the death of their son. He would go into a kind of daze,
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room. Then he got up suddenly
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal state.
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided
the cemetery. 

PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.
He was friends with the two youngest boys. Edgar the eldest, would not
condescend at first. And Miriam also refused to be approached.
She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own brothers.
The girl was romantic in her soul. Everywhere was a Walter Scott
heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps.
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swine-girl
in her own imagination. And she was afraid lest this boy,
who, nevertheless, looked something like a Walter Scott hero,
who could paint and speak French, and knew what algebra meant,
and who went by train to Nottingham every day, might consider her
simply as the swine-girl, unable to perceive the princess beneath;
so she held aloof.

Her great companion was her mother. They were both brown-eyed,
and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life
in a mist thereof. So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great figure,
which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset
burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de
Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves
in the morning, or sat in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.
That was life to her. For the rest, she drudged in the house,
which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been
mucked up immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe
him and stifle him in her love; she went to church reverently,
with bowed head, and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the
other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate;
she fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts;
and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not
carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted
to have as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready
for them.

She hated her position as swine-girl. She wanted to be considered.
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as Paul said
he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de ma Chambre", the
world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect.
She could not be princess by wealth or standing. So she was mad
to have learning whereon to pride herself. For she was different
from other folk, and must not be scooped up among the common fry.
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire.

would be stronger than he. Then she could love him. If she could
